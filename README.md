### Oscar ads

This directory contains data behind the story [Hollywood Studios Barely Promoted Non-White Actors and Films](http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/oscars-diversity-hollywood-ad-campaign).

This is an inventory of "For Your Consideration" advertisements placed in Variety and The Hollywood Reporter from the beginning of November 2015 through the last issue published before the 2016 Academy Awards nomination voting deadline. 

The folder `oscar_campaign_project` contains sequential photographs of each of the advertisments listed here, for the benefit of future analysis regarding uncoded things. (THR stands for The Hollywood Reporter.)

We mainly look at aggregate ad placement. Still, a further analysis coding each advertisement based on what awards they specifically asked to be considered for or who was highlighted in each advertisement could be a fruitful avenue of research. 

Column | Description
----- | --------
issue | The issue of the magazine the advertisement appeared in. THR-XX refers to the XX issue of The Hollywood Reporter in 2015. VAR-XX refers to an issue number I assigned to it for identification purposes. 
firstpage | The page the advertisement appears on, or if it's a multiple page advertisement the first page it is on, or if it's an insert the page the insert appears near. "Cov" refers to a cover advertisement. "BC" refers to the back cover advertisement. Page "0" refers to the inside front cover. Typically, the last listed ad, if it's a full page ad, was the inside back cover.

dimension_1, dimension_2 | The dimensions in inches of the advertisement, with no particular order regarding the length and width of the ad. 
area | The area of the advertisement in square inches.
